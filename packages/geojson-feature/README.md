# GeoJSON Feature DataModel

## Installation

```sh
npm install -D @datamodels/geojson-feature
```

## Rationale

Eventhough humans are connecting more and more through spaces that only exist on computer networks around the world, we'll always have the need to refer to some earthly spacial context when communicating with each other.

The **GeoJSON Feature** datamodel is a battle tested and commonly used standard for encoding a variety of geographic data structures.

By bringing this standard into datamodels, we'll allow people to own, refer and collaborate around spacial features.
